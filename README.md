# Summary

Boss Rush API mod is a mod that allows the creation of Boss Rush events in the game. It does not any content into the game. It is a framework for other mods to use to create Boss Rush events.

This repository includes the source code for Boss Rush API mod, as well as a **playable** example mod which implements the Boss Rush API.

This mod is not strictly necessary to be implemented by a content mod; it is possible to create a completely separate mod that implements the Boss Rush API alongside other content mods to mash together the bosses from different mods in the Boss Rush event.

If interested, the [repository wiki](https://github.com/tieeeeen1994/tModLoader-BossRush/wiki) contains guides on how to implement the API.
